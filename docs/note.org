** Oscillator = generates waveforms at different pitch
*** Triangle
*** Saw
*** Square
*** Pulse
** Filter = Timbre
*** Subtractive synthesis removes some frequencies or emphasis some
** Amplifer = Amplitude

*** Low sub-audible frequency range where its output use as source of modulation
** Envelope generator (ASDR)
*** modulation source to control synthesizer parameter
*** Attack time, Decay Time,  Sustain Level, Release Time
*** Create filter sweep and create volume shape in amplifier to mimic certain instruments
* Electronic Music Synthesis & Audio Effects Processing
** Music notes, pitch and octave
*** Characterized by fundamental frequency and its ratios = overtones

** Timbre & Physical Modelling

*** Tone quality. Charateristic quality of a sound often used to discern instruments

*** Frequency Spectrum (relative energy distribution of partials) affect timbre

*** Variation in amplitude such as attack and fade time also affet timbre

** Additive synthesis

*** using sinusoids of different frequency and amplitude ratio

** FM Synthesis

** Audio Effects

*** Echo (repeat signal after a delay with reduced gain)

*** Reverb (persistence of sound after being produced due to reflection)

*** Flanging 

*** Chorus

*** Bass (tone in low-pitched range)

*** Treble (high frequency)

*** WahWah Effect (altering resonance of musical notes)

*** Tremolo (variation of amplitude)

*** Fade In Fade Out
