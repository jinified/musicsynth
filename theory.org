*** [[https://dsp.stackexchange.com/questions/536/what-is-meant-by-a-systems-impulse-response-and-frequency-response][Characterize a LTI(Linear Time Invariant) system with:]]
**** Impulse response
**** Frequency response
*** Difference equation to compute output of a sample
**** Combination of past input samples and output samples
**** FIR + IIR filters
** Source-filter model
*** Combination of source and filter to generate speech assume independence of source and filter
*** Vocal tract shapes act as filter to produce different sound
** LPC (Linear Predictive Coding) FIR Filter
*** Output samples calculated from linear combination of filter coefficients and previous samples
*** Levinson-Durbin algorithm to find coefficients that minimize squared prediction error
*** Using FIR filter for prediction error calculation
*** *Aim: Generate residual* 
** LP (Linear Prediction) IIR Filter
*** represents spectral model of input samples
*** *Aim: Recover input signal given residual from FIR filter*
** Full-system
*** [[file:data/lpc.png]]
*** We can get excitation if the coefficients are the same which cancel each other out
* UNSW Speech & Audio Processing 1
** Voiced speech (vocal chord vibrates)
*** Discrete puffs in time domain. Vibrates at fundamental frequency
** Unvoiced sound (vocal chords held open)
*** High frequency component sound
** Format frequencies (resonant in the vocal tract)
*** [[file:data/speech_model.png]]
*** Voiced sound: enhances low frequency component vice versa for unvoiced
*** *Small frame extracted cause waveform appear stationary then*
** Model of Speech Production
*** Excitation source: dirac delta function (impulse train) taking the z-transform
*** [[file:data/excitation_equation.png]]
*** [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4IyRw1zvvA][What is z-transform ?]] 
**** Identifies presence of exponentially increasing or decreasing oscillation in signal
**** Used to determine system's frequency response
**** Finding correlation between signal, x(n) and z^-n
*** Glottal model, G(z) typically a low pass filter to produce the shape instead of sharp peaks
*** Vocal tract model
**** All-pole model = constant numerator / polynomial denominator.
