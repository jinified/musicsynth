* Do Mobile Phones Dream Of Electronic Orchestras ?
** Original Repertoire
*** Mapping accelerometer: up-down -> spectral richness and (left-right) -> fundamental frequency for FM synthesis
*** Preprogrammed modulation ratios and pitches for selection
*** Circle map effect
*** DJ control loopback rate by tilting and changes timbre based on accelerometer
*** Using it as a diffuser in space

* Ocarina

** Physical interaction design process

*** How many points multi touch allowed ?

*** Uses accelerometer for vibrato (left-right), timbre(front-back)

*** Using ChucK to track amplitude of incoming signal

** Sound synthesis

*** ChucK program consists of amplitude tracker and articulator
