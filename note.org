* Do Mobile Phones Dream Of Electronic Orchestras ?
** Original Repertoire
*** Mapping accelerometer: up-down -> spectral richness and (left-right) -> fundamental frequency for FM synthesis
*** Preprogrammed modulation ratios and pitches for selection
*** Circle map effect
*** DJ control loopback rate by tilting and changes timbre based on accelerometer
*** Using it as a diffuser in space

* Ocarina

** Physical interaction design process

*** How many points multi touch allowed ?

*** Uses accelerometer for vibrato (left-right), timbre(front-back)

*** Using ChucK to track amplitude of incoming signal

** Sound synthesis

*** ChucK program consists of amplitude tracker and articulator

* Toolkits
** STK (Synthesis Toolkit)
* Feature Analysis
** RMS of a window of samples or Highest sample as -> *Amplitude* 
** Number of zero crossings -> *Pitch*
* Ideas
** MOGAT: Auditory training for pitch perception, pitch production
** Gesture-based Interactive Re-mixeable Dance Floor (GIRD) Music Tech Fest
** ChoirMob, Vuzik
** Granular Synthesis
** UrMus live coding
** SuperCollider
** Overtone
* Mapping motion to timbre: FM Synthesis
** [[file:data/mapmotiont_timbre.png]]
** Mapping:
*** Pitch recognition = carrier frequency
*** elevation = modulation ratio
*** rotation = modulation index
* Interactive Virtual Percussion
** Editing mode allows for creation of virtual instruments from different materials
** Sound synthesis: Physical waveguide synthesis (Cook 2007)
* The Interactive Music Producer
** Music & Sound Production
*** Ableton Live, Max for Live, PureData, Max
*** Composing interactive music (Winkler 1998)
** Interactive Technologies
*** user experience and they way music is perceived 
*** Music and Human-Computer Interaction (Holland 2013)
** Data Mapping and Manipulation
*** Interactive Music 3.0(Quay 2012), Making Motion Musical (Bevilacqua), Drummond 2009
*** Wekinator, Gesture Follower
*** Dynamic Music Objects (Thalmann 2016) 
* AuRal: A Mobile Interactive System for Geo-Locative Audio Synthesis
** Client App
*** Uses Android port of SuperCollider
*** Uses spatial data to synthesize sound
* Game Design for Expressive Mobile Music
** Magic Piano: simple, hardcoded music note and pitch
** Magic Fiddle
** Ocarina
** Leaf Trombone
* Grab & Play: Creative Mapping
** Based on Wekinator with additional features:
*** Interface with any synthesizer that accepts OSC messages
*** [[http://github.com/hugoscurto/GrabAndPlayWeki][Source Code]] 
* Sound Synthesis: History & Theory
** Oscillator = generates waveforms at different pitch
*** Triangle
*** Saw
*** Square
*** Pulse
** Filter = Timbre
*** Subtractive synthesis removes some frequencies or emphasis some
** Amplifer = Amplitude
*** Varying amplitude modify characteristics. marimba and accordion
** Low Frequency Oscillator (LFO)
*** Low sub-audible frequency range where its output use as source of modulation
** Envelope generator (ASDR)
*** modulation source to control synthesizer parameter
*** Attack time, Decay Time,  Sustain Level, Release Time
*** Create filter sweep and create volume shape in amplifier to mimic certain instruments
* Electronic Music Synthesis & Audio Effects Processing
** Music notes, pitch and octave
*** Characterized by fundamental frequency and its ratios = overtones
*** [[file:data/note_frequencies.png]]

** Timbre & Physical Modelling

*** Tone quality. Charateristic quality of a sound often used to discern instruments

*** Frequency Spectrum (relative energy distribution of partials) affect timbre

*** Variation in amplitude such as attack and fade time also affet timbre

** Additive synthesis

*** using sinusoids of different frequency and amplitude ratio

** FM Synthesis

** Audio Effects

*** Echo (repeat signal after a delay with reduced gain)

*** Reverb (persistence of sound after being produced due to reflection)

*** Flanging 

*** Chorus

*** Bass (tone in low-pitched range)

*** Treble (high frequency)

*** WahWah Effect (altering resonance of musical notes)

*** Tremolo (variation of amplitude)

*** Fade In Fade Out
