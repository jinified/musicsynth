* Do Mobile Phones Dream Of Electronic Orchestras ?
** Original Repertoire
*** Mapping accelerometer: up-down -> spectral richness and (left-right) -> fundamental frequency for FM synthesis
*** Preprogrammed modulation ratios and pitches for selection
*** Circle map effect
*** DJ control loopback rate by tilting and changes timbre based on accelerometer
*** Using it as a diffuser in space

* Ocarina

** Physical interaction design process

*** How many points multi touch allowed ?

*** Uses accelerometer for vibrato (left-right), timbre(front-back)

*** Using ChucK to track amplitude of incoming signal

** Sound synthesis

*** ChucK program consists of amplitude tracker and articulator

* Toolkits
** STK (Synthesis Toolkit)
* Feature Analysis
** RMS of a window of samples or Highest sample as -> *Amplitude* 
** Number of zero crossings -> *Pitch*
* Ideas
** MOGAT: Auditory training for pitch perception, pitch production
* Mapping motion to timbre: FM Synthesis
** [[file:data/mapmotiont_timbre.png]]
** Mapping:
*** Pitch recognition = carrier frequency
*** elevation = modulation ratio
*** rotation = modulation index
